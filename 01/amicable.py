# Predicate that determines if 2 numbers are friends
# (amicable). Friendly numbers are two natural numbers such that
# that the sum of all proper divisors of a number is equal
# to the second number, and vice versa â€“ the sum of all proper divisors
# of the second number is equal to the first.
#
# We consider all of its positive divisors to be proper divisors of a number
# of divisors excluding the number itself; e.g. own divisors
# 12 numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6.
