# Python_projects
Each project and function is explained in comments inside the code. The projects are simple and a good way to learn python.

Every folder has projects inside it, each focused on a specific area (variables, dictionaries, type aliases, classes, objects, methods, etc.)

Projects outside of the folders are little bit more complicated.
